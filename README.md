## About

**Kamu Web Platform** is a **front-end application** that acts as a window into the decentralized [Open Data Fabric](https://docs.kamu.dev/odf/) (ODF) network.

**If you are new to the project** we recommend you to start with [Kamu CLI tool](https://docs.kamu.dev/cli/) to learn the basics of ODF in the comfort of your laptop.

&nbsp;  

Think of it as [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) for ODF or GitHub for data pipelines. It can be used in multiple setups:
- On a laptop to explore and build pipelines together with [kamu-cli](https://github.com/kamu-data/kamu-cli)
- Deployed as a private cloud or on-premise data platform in combination with [kamu-node](https://github.com/kamu-data/kamu-node)
- As a window into the global ODF network to interact with millions of decentralized data sources and supply chains.

## Get Started
By far the simplest way to try it out is using [kamu-cli](https://github.com/kamu-data/kamu-cli) - simply [install](https://docs.kamu.dev/cli/get-started/installation/) it and run this command in your workspace:

```sh
kamu ui
```

## Helm Chart
You can deploy Kamu Web platform into a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster using [Helm](https://helm.sh/) and our latest chart from [ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?org=kamu).

See [deployment manual](https://docs.kamu.dev/node/deploy/) on how to deploy the Web Platform alongside [kamu-node](https://github.com/kamu-data/kamu-node).
